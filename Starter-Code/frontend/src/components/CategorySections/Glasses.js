Glass Waste Facts
and Statistics
Glass is one of the most used materials in the world. Windows, tables, drinks vessels, food containers, vases, and more are all made from glass. Humans have used the material for thousands of years. Today, homes and businesses across the UK and beyond create high volumes of glass waste every day.

The most important fact about glass is that glass is 100% recyclable. It can be infinitely recycled without losing quality and turned into new products. This means glass should never go to landfill and always be reused. However, global glass recycling rates aren’t 100%, so there’s still plenty of work to do.</p>
